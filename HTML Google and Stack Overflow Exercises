Exercise 5: JavaScript DOM Manipulation
https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/dom-document-object-model/
Document object: When an HTML document is loaded into a window, it becomes a document object. The ‘document’ object has various properties that refer to other objects which allow access to and modification of the content of the web page. If there is a need to access any element in an HTML page, we always start with accessing the ‘document’ object. Document object is property of window object.
